Processing and Arduino
==============================


By Scott Kildall

Two simple sketches which send one byte between Processing and Arduino

##### LEDFlashy: 
Sends a number from Processing and Arduino will flash and LED that number of times.

The LED will be on pin 7

##### GrowBar:
Sends a 1 or 0 from Arduino, so while the button is pressed, the fill on the rectangle will get slowly get larger
